# My First React Project

This is my first React project where I am learning web development. I'm using this project to understand the fundamentals of React and modern web development practices.

## About Me
I'm a beginner in web development, and this project is part of my learning journey. Through this project, I aim to:
- Learn React fundamentals
- Understand modern web development practices
- Build interactive web applications
- Develop my programming skills

### Prerequisites and Learning Path
Before diving into React, I'm building a strong foundation by learning:
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) for structuring web content
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and layout
- JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic functionality

This comprehensive approach ensures I have a solid understanding of web development fundamentals before working with React.

## Getting Started
This project was created using Vite + React, which provides a fast and modern development environment.
